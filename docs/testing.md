# Testing

## Unit tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

`tests/Tenet.Tests` covers universe levels, substitution, the type checker on hand-built
terms, and the two committed fixtures (`tests/fixtures`), including negative tests: a
tampered proof and a tampered recursor rule must both be rejected.

## Large exports

The real test is the Lean core library. Exports are large (all of `Init` is about 350 MB)
and are never committed; generate them:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leanprover/lean4export
cd lean4export && lake build
mkdir -p ~/tenet-exports
lake env .lake/build/bin/lean4export Init.Prelude > ~/tenet-exports/Init.Prelude.ndjson
lake env .lake/build/bin/lean4export Init.Core    > ~/tenet-exports/Init.Core.ndjson
lake env .lake/build/bin/lean4export Init         > ~/tenet-exports/Init.ndjson
```

Then either run the checker directly:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project src/Tenet.Cli -- check ~/tenet-exports/Init.Prelude.ndjson
```

or let the integration tests pick them up:

```bash
TENET_EXPORTS=~/tenet-exports dotnet test
```

The tests for files that are not present are skipped silently.

## Reading a failure

```
FAIL thm Nat.add_succ (0.01s)
    declaration type mismatch for 'Nat.add_succ'
      expected: ...
      inferred: ...
```

Every failure names the declaration, the kernel's reason, and how long it took. With the
default settings the checker keeps going after a failure, installing the exporter's own
view of the failed declaration so that later ones can still be checked; use `--fail-fast`
to stop at the first one. `--only Foo.bar,Foo.baz` checks just those declarations and adds
everything else unchecked, which is the quick way to iterate on one failure.

## Memory on very large exports

The checker keeps every expression of the export in memory (later declarations refer to
earlier ones by table index, and the environment needs every constant's type and value
for unfolding). Expect roughly 5 bytes of resident memory per byte of export with the
default server garbage collector, and about a third of that with the workstation
collector, which is slower but frugal:

```bash
DOTNET_gcServer=0 tenet check Mathlib.ndjson --jobs 4
```

Intermediate settings keep server GC but cap its appetite:

```bash
DOTNET_GCHeapCount=4 DOTNET_GCConserveMemory=7 tenet check Mathlib.ndjson
```
